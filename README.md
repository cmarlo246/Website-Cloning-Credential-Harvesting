🔐 Ethical Hacking Lab: Website Cloning & Credential Harvesting

As part of my Cisco Ethical Hacker certification journey and training with the ParoCyber Bootcamp, I completed a hands-on lab focused on social engineering and phishing simulation using the Social Engineer Toolkit (SET).

🧪 What I Did:

Launched and explored SET in a controlled Kali Linux environment

Used Website Attack Vectors → Credential Harvester → Site Cloner

Cloned a vulnerable DVWA login page

Captured submitted credentials and analyzed attacker workflow

Observed how users are redirected to the legitimate site after credential capture

🔍 What I Learned:

Social engineering attacks exploit human behavior, not technical flaws

Website cloning can be extremely convincing if users do not verify URLs

Security awareness training is just as important as technical controls

⚖️ Ethical Context:

This lab was conducted strictly in an authorized virtual lab environment for educational and defensive security purposes. These techniques are used by ethical hackers to assess organizational risk and improve security posture.
